# Web Development Project 7 - **Box-Box-Box**

Submitted by: **Ruhi Sawant**

This web app: **Box-Box-Box** is a Formula 1-themed team management platform where users can create, view, update, and delete crewmate profiles representing members of an F1 teamâ€”like engineers, drivers, strategists, and more. Each member includes role-based styling and custom attributes to simulate real pit crew roles.

Time spent: **25** hours spent in total
